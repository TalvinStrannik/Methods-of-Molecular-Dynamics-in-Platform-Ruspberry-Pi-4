# Methods-of-Molecular-Dynamics-in-Platform-Ruspberry-Pi-4
Joint project with K. Kolesnikov. March 2023 - May 2023

This is modeling and data analysis work. I did some modeling and generated direct output using the NumPy library. Evaluated and prepared initialization data. The work demonstrates the Monte Carlo method on the Ruspberry Pi4 platform (for organizing clusters and low-cost high-performance systems).

I reported and defended our work at the 80th Scientific Conference of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Students of BSU
